# Arcade_tennis_Game

## **Introduction**
This is a simple arcade-style game of tennis where we play against a bot. The web-application is made out of pure javascript and html.


## **Usage**
Just download the zip file, and enjoy the game.

## **Improvements To Be Made**
The game can have a play-style where with each successful hit of the user, the game gets tougher. (This change will be made in a few days).
