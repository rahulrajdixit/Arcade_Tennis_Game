# Arcade_tennis_Game

## **Introduction**
This is a simple arcade-style game of tennis where we play against a bot. The web-application is made with the help of just HTML and Javascript.

## **Improvements To Be Made**
The game can have a play-style where with each successful hit/save of the user, the speed of the ball increases. (This change will be made in a few days).
